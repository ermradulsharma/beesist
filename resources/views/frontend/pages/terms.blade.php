            </ol>
            <p>We will only collect, use, and share your personal information where we have a lawful basis to do so.
                Lawful bases include (i) contract (if processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with
                you), (ii) consent (where you have given consent), (iii) legitimate interests of AtEase BnB or third
                parties or (iv) as otherwise may be allowed by applicable law and consistent with this Privacy
                Policy.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Certain countries and regions allow us to process personal information on the basis of legitimate
                interests. If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our&nbsp;legitimate interests
                (or the legitimate interests of any third-party), this&nbsp;interest will typically be to operate or
                improve our website and communicate&nbsp;with you as necessary to provide our services to you, for
                security verification&nbsp;purposes when you contact us, to respond to your queries,
                undertaking&nbsp;marketing, or for the purposes of potentially detecting or preventing
                illegal&nbsp;activities. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>We may in some cases use automated decision-making, for example, in relation to assessing fraudulent
                transactions or suspicious activity on our site. As part of this processing, automated decisions may be
                made by putting your personal information into a system and the decision is calculated using automatic
                processes. If you pose a fraud risk, this may affect your ability to book on our site. You may have
                rights in relation to automated decision making, including the ability to request a manual
                decision-making process instead or contest a decision based solely on automated processing. If you want
                to know more about your data protection rights, please see the Your Rights and Choices section

                <li><strong>SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION&nbsp;</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>We share your personal information as described below and in this Privacy Policy, and as permitted by

            <ul>
                <li> <strong>Third-party service providers. </strong>We share personal information with third-parties in
                    connection with the delivery of services to you and the operation of our business (for example, to
                    provide credit card processing, customer service, business analytics, and fraud prevention and
                    compliance services, and to serve you with advertising tailored to your interests). These
                    third-party service providers are required to protect personal information we share with them and
                    may not use any directly identifying personal information other than to provide services we
                    contracted them for. They are not allowed to use the personal information we share for purposes of
                    their own direct marketing (unless you have separately consented with the third-party under the
                    terms provided by the third-party).</li>
                <li> <strong>Business partners and offers.  </strong>If we promote a program or offer a service or
                    product in conjunction with a third-party business partner, we will share your information with that
                    partner to assist in marketing or to provide the associated product or service.  In most of those
                    cases, the program or offer will include the name of the third-party business partner, either alone
                    or with ours, or you will be redirected to the website of that business with notice. An example of
                    such a business-partner relationship would be a third-party loyalty program for which you could earn
                    points by completing a booking on our website.</li>
                <li> <strong>Other Third-Parties.</strong> If you access certain features like Facebook’s “Like” button
                    or a single sign-on that allows you to login with your social media credentials to our online
                    services, you will share information with the third-party, like a social media company, such as the
                    fact that you have visited or interacted with us. The third-party provider may combine this
                    information with other information they have about you. The personal information shared will be
                    governed by the third-party provider’s privacy policy (including any personal information we may
                    access via the third-party provider). The third-party providers should inform you about how you can
                    modify your privacy settings on their site.</li>
                <li> <strong>Legal rights and obligations. </strong>We may disclose your personal information to enforce
                    our policies, or where we are permitted (or believe in good faith that we are required) to do so by
                    applicable law, such as in response to a request by a law enforcement or governmental authority, in
                    connection with actual or proposed litigation, or to protect and defend our property, people and
                    other rights or interests. We may also share your personal information pursuant to a subpoena or
                    other legal request, or as necessary to remit certain taxes in the course of processing payments as
                    required by law or legal process.</li>
                <li> <strong>Corporate transactions. </strong>We may share your personal information in connection with
                    a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, assignments or asset sale, or
                    in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. In the case of any acquisition, we will inform the buyer it
